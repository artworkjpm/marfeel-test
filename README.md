### Marfeel-test
This test was quite tough, the biggest challenge was using d3.js for the first time, making a pie chart and line graph using svg, then placing the line graph inside the pie chart.

### Things I like:
* I made two data csv's for the line graph.
* I understand d3.js better now, maybe I would use another data visualisation tool next time, it seems kind of old and clunky with d3.js. 

### Things I dislike:
* I spent a long time on this, like 15hrs altogether. I did this when I wasn't doing other paid projects. I would have liked to have put the the js files into one js file, making a pie chart component and mapping the data, maybe through recursion. As you mentioned not to use vue.js or any framework, this would be a challenge. 
* I cheated for the carousel, I am using bootstrap, again, to save time. 

### Ending note

Obviously you are looking for the highest quality javascript developer, I am not there yet with vanilla javascript, I am still learning things, its quite hard to go from jquery, vue.js, angular, down to vanilla js but I see the benefits of vanilla js. I still have the skills to produce what you wanted and created near pixel perfect result. Ok, my code could be more DRY, if I spent more time I could refactor it, but seeing as this is an unpaid test I'm not willing to spend any more time on this. However I hope you like the results and let me know if you'd like to chat.
